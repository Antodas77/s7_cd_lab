1. Start
2. Create a character array line[100] to hold each line of input.
3. Define functions to identify operators, delimiters, keywords, integers, and floating-point
numbers.
4. Open the input file input.txt for reading.
5. While there are lines to read in the file:
5.1 Read a line into the line array.
5.2 Initialize flags for comment detection (flag1 for single-line comments, flag2
for multi-line comments) to false.
5.3 For each character in the line, if the character is '/' and the next character is '/',
set flag1 to true and skip processing the line.
5.4 For each character in the line, if the character is '/' and the next character is '*',
skip lines until you find the closing '*/' and set flag2 to true and skip
processing the line.
5.5 Initialize an empty token string and an index counter set to 0.
5.6 For each character in the line:
5.6.1 If token is a keyword, print it as a keyword.
5.6.2 Else if token is an integer or floating-point number, print it as a
number.
5.6.3 Else, print it as an identifier.
5.6.4 Clear the token string and reset the index counter.
5.6.5 If the character is whitespace (space, tab, or newline), continue to
the next character.
5.6.6 If the character is not an operator, delimiter, or whitespace, add it
to the token string and increment the index.
6. Close the input file after processing all lines.
7. Stop
