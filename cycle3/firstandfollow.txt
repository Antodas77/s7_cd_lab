1.Input the number of productions and the grammar rules.
2.Initialize arrays for storing First and Follow sets, and flags to track if the computation for each
non-terminal is done.
3. For each non-terminal, find the First set:
3.1 If the first symbol in the production is a terminal, add it to the First set.
3.2 If the first symbol is a non-terminal, recursively compute its First set.
3.3 If the First set of the non-terminal contains 'ε', continue checking the next symbol in
the production.
4. Mark the First set computation for the non-terminal as done.
5. For the start symbol, add '$' to the Follow set.
6. For each production, find the Follow set:
6.1 If a non-terminal is followed by a terminal, add that terminal to the Follow set.
6.2 If a non-terminal is followed by another non-terminal, add the First set of the latter
(excluding 'ε') to the Follow set.
6.3 If a non-terminal appears at the end of a production or is followed by a non-terminal
whose First set contains 'ε', add the Follow set of the left-hand side of the production to
the current non-terminal's Follow set.
7. Mark the Follow set computation for the non-terminal as done.
8. Print the First and Follow sets for each non-terminal.
