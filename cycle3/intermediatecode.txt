1. Start
2. Declare necessary headers.
3. Declare a variable reg initialized to 'Z' to store intermediate results.
4. Read the input string inp(arithmetic expression)
5. Define the order of operator precedence: /, *, +, -, =
6. For each operator from highest precedence to lowest
a) Traverse the input string inp character by character
b) If an operator matches the current operator:
i) Print the operator and the operands (characters before and after the operator) as
three-address code.
ii) Assign the result to the current register (reg).
iii) Update the expression by replacing the operands and operator with the register.
iv) Decrement the register to use the next available register for further operations.
c) Continue the traversal until the end of the string.
7. Repeat step 6 for the next operator in the precedence order, continuing until all operators
are processed
8. Stop
