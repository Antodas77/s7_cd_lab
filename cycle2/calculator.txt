1. The program begins in main(), prompting the user to input an arithmetic expression.
2. yyparse() is called to start parsing the input.
3. The lexical analyzer matches patterns for numbers ([0-9]+) and arithmetic operators (+, -,
*, /) and returns tokens to the parser.
4. The parser uses the following CFG:
 start → expression
 expression → expression '+' term | expression '-' term | term
 term → term '*' factor | term '/' factor | factor
 factor → '(' expression ')' | NUMBER
5. The parser processes tokens based on the CFG rules, performing arithmetic operations as
it matches expressions.
6. Intermediate results are calculated and stored using the semantic actions associated with
each rule.
7. If an invalid token or character is encountered, the lexer prints an error message.
8. After successfully parsing, the result of the expression is printed.
9. If any syntax errors occur, yyerror() is invoked, printing an error message.The program
terminates after displaying the result or an error message.
