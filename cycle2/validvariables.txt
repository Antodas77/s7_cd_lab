1. The program begins in main() where the user is prompted to input a string.
2. yyparse() is called to start the parsing process.
3. The lexical analyzer identifies tokens based on patterns: letter for identifiers and digit for
numbers.
4. The lexer returns letter for [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]* and digit for [0-9] to the YACC
parser.
5. The parser uses the CFG rules:
 start → letter s
 s → letter s | digit s | ε
6. The parser checks if the input follows these rules, defining valid identifiers starting with a
letter.
7. If the input matches the CFG, the parsing continues successfully.
8. If the input violates the CFG, yyerror() is called, setting valid = 0 and printing an error
message.
9. After parsing, main() checks the valid flag.
10. If valid, it prints "It is an identifier"; otherwise, it prints an error message.
