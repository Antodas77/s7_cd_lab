1. The program begins execution in the main function, which prompts the user to enter a
string and calls yylex() to start scanning input.
2. Lex Rule: The rule [a-zA-Z]* matches any sequence of alphabetic characters (including
an empty string).
3. Substring Check: The program loops through the current token yytext to see if it contains
the first four letters of your name as a substring.
4. If the first four letters of your name is found within the input string, a flag is set to
indicate its presence. The matched string is then stored in the name variable for later use.
5. After processing the string, the program checks the flag and displays messages based on
whether the first four letters of your name were found or not.
